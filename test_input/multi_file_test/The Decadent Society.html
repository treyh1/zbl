</div><div class='authors'>
Douthat, Ross Gregory 
</div></h1><hr/>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Introduction</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 5 &middot; Location 84</div><div class='noteText'>So it is a significant factor in our era’s anxieties , in the sense of drift and stagnation and uncertainty with which this book is principally concerned , that the actual physical frontier has been closed for a generation or more — that for the first time since 1491 , we have found the distances too vast and the technology too limited to take us to somewhere genuinely undiscovered , somewhere truly new .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 216</div><div class='noteText'>“ What fascinates and terrifies us about the Roman Empire is not that it finally went smash , ” wrote W . H . Auden of the last world empire in its endless autumn , but rather that “ it managed to last for four centuries without creativity , warmth , or hope . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part 1: The Four Horsemen</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1: Stagnation &gt; Page 42 &middot; Location 612</div><div class='noteText'>Indeed , it’s telling that even within the Silicon Valley landscape , the most stable success stories are often the purest computer - and - Internet enterprises — social media companies , device manufacturers , software companies — while the frauds and failures and big money - losers and possible catastrophes tend to involve efforts to use tech to transform some other industry , from music festivals to office - space rentals to food delivery to blood tests .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2: Sterility &gt; Page 55 &middot; Location 808</div><div class='noteText'>In low - fertility Japan , a recent study from the Family Planning Agency found that 45 percent of women ages sixteen to twenty - four and a quarter of men “ were not interested in or despised sexual contact . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2: Sterility &gt; Page 64 &middot; Location 950</div><div class='noteText'>Isn’t it possible , instead , that the technocrats might end up winning themselves the worst of both worlds , since mass immigration hasn’t actually staved off stagnation and sclerosis , but it has created a restive minority population and a reactionary backlash that between them are pushing the entire system deeper into crisis ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4: Repetition &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 1439</div><div class='noteText'>The reality of recurrence may be slightly harder for progressives to acknowledge than conservatives , because progressivism is more invested in its supposed position at the vanguard of cultural change , pressing boldly on to new frontiers . This makes it difficult for the left to recognize the generational recycling of its ambitions and anxieties : the fact that many progressive “ breakthroughs ” are just the culture cycling back to something that we did not that long ago — up to and including kick - ass female action heroes such as Wonder Woman ( who followed a path blazed by Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley in the Alien movies , or the robot - wrangling Sarah Connor in the Terminator movies , or even the blaster - wielding Princess Leia in Star Wars forty years ago ) or the African American heroes in Black Panther . ( In truth , black stars were arguably more important in the years of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor and The Cosby Show and the young Denzel Washington than in our officially representation - obsessed age . )</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 4: Repetition &gt; Page 102 &middot; Location 1503</div><div class='noteText'>And the religious torpor betokened by the decline of cults can be linked to intellectual torpor generally — the religious element in the culturewide feeling , to borrow from the pessimistic Peter Thiel , that there are fewer and fewer “ secrets left to be discovered . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part 2: Sustainable Decadence</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 150 &middot; Location 2171</div><div class='noteText'>Tellingly , both incarceration and abortion are hidden forms of violence , one imposed through a distant archipelago of prisons and the other in the darkness of the womb , both creating an illusion of peace sustained by a denial of the reality of what happened in a cellblock , what the abortionist dealt out . But , also tellingly , both have become less necessary to the system over time : as the pink police state has come of age , abortion rates have fallen alongside both crime and incarceration rates — both because virtual sex no less than virtual violence takes the edge off real - world desire , and also because the system relies increasingly on chemical solutions that are kinder than abortion , such as the temporary sterilization of Depo - Provera , to make sure that the poor don’t have too many kids . And then it also relies on pharmaceutical abortions , so that the violence that remains is even more secret and private than before .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 150 &middot; Location 2184</div><div class='noteText'>A system of control that requires huge prisons and 1.5 million abortions annually will inspire outrage , activism , and protest . But a system of control that relies on constant surveillance , technologically abetted house arrest , virtual entertainments and pharmaceutical sterilization and prescription abortions will fade more into the background of everyday life . The underlying problems that require these responses may worsen or just languish unaddressed , but they won’t trouble the nation’s conscience nearly as much as in the recent past .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 151 &middot; Location 2188</div><div class='noteText'>The picture he paints is dystopic but i would be careful about assigning intentionality to all this. No evil genius designed all this.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 151 &middot; Location 2193</div><div class='noteText'>Thus , the present antiwar dilemma : as the Yale law professor Samuel Moyn writes , “ The containment and minimization of violence in America’s wars … have only made it harder to criticize America’s use of force in other countries . ” The more surgically precise the intervention , the more sustainable it becomes . With enough technique , the forever war can last forever .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 152 &middot; Location 2216</div><div class='noteText'>What Trump wants , more than power — which he has but does not know how to use — is attention , retweets , televised and online validation .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 153 &middot; Location 2231</div><div class='noteText'>Which is why you could make the case that a true radicalism , a true threat to the Panopticon , would not be visible online at all ; the rebellions that we can see percolating are , almost by definition , codependent with the system , constrained and pushed constantly toward entertainment by their choice to depend upon and negotiate with an order they supposedly abhor . And this too is a reason to regard the new populism and its weaker left - wing analogues as challenges that the system might be able to handle , haphazardly but effectively , without either revolution or reform .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 154 &middot; Location 2235</div><div class='noteText'>Anything short of this true resistance devolves back to mere entertainment.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 154 &middot; Location 2236</div><div class='noteText'>Underclass fatherlessness , working - class disarray , drug abuse , out - of - wedlock births , loneliness , childlessness , suicide , general postreligious anomie , terrorism , and radicalization of all kinds — these would all persist without resolution . This persistence wouldn’t pass unnoticed ; indeed , it would regularly inspire political rebellions . But the rebellions would be swiftly reabsorbed into the entertainment portion of the Panopticon , their leaders would be swiftly drawn into negotiations over their audience share and their right to monetize their antiestablishment message — and meanwhile , the underlying problems would continue to be managed , and managed , and managed , by screens and drugs and drones for some indefinite period of time .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 6: A Kindly Despotism &gt; Page 154 &middot; Location 2241</div><div class='noteText'>Screens drugs drones</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 7: Waiting for the Barbarians &gt; Page 162 &middot; Location 2355</div><div class='noteText'>the West’s would - be rivals lack the mix of zeal , coherence , mysticism , and futurism that tends to propel challengers to established world pictures .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 7: Waiting for the Barbarians &gt; Page 174 &middot; Location 2550</div><div class='noteText'>There would be an elite that seems interchangeable from country to country , a restive impotence and a lot of human suffering wherever that elite is hated or opposed , zones of chaos and disorder that don’t really threaten the metropole , and no nation or civilization charting a radically different course . That’s a useful distillation of what it would mean for decadence to continue despite recent disturbances , and , indeed , to gradually become universal ; that might be what sustainable decadence would mean .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 7: Waiting for the Barbarians &gt; Page 175 &middot; Location 2555</div><div class='noteText'>Why this sudden restlessness , this confusion ? Because night has fallen and the barbarians have not come .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 7: Waiting for the Barbarians &gt; Page 175 &middot; Location 2556</div><div class='noteText'>Douthat makes refedrence to Waitibg for the Barbarians. I like a comparison to the Coetzee book where the barbarians never show. Islam, Russia, China are all unlikey to mount an existential external challenge to the West.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 8: Giving Decadence Its Due &gt; Page 185 &middot; Location 2681</div><div class='noteText'>So it must be met , not by fantasies of ennobling world wars , not by Tyler Durden from Fight Club planning to blow up all credit card companies and Ikea living rooms sky - high , but by the hope that where there’s stability , there also might eventually be renewal , that decadence need not give way to collapse to be escaped — that , instead , it can be transcended , that the renaissance can happen without the misery of an intervening dark age .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part 3: The Deaths of Decadence</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 9: Catastrophe &gt; Page 198 &middot; Location 2834</div><div class='noteText'>In the late 1990s , Europe and Africa had about the same population ; a hundred years later , there could be seven Africans for every European . Even with the Mediterranean between them , and the Sahara as an impediment , that kind of equilibrium cannot be plausibly sustained . In some form or another , manageable or not , Eurafrica is coming .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 9: Catastrophe &gt; Page 201 &middot; Location 2876</div><div class='noteText'>The United States would find its Augustus or see the establishment of a kind of enlightened Politburo , merging the power of the two remaining nondecadent institutions in the country — Silicon Valley and the military — in a system that retained republican forms the way China currently retains Marxist ones , as pleasant illusions and rhetorical gestures that nobody believes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 9: Catastrophe &gt; Page 203 &middot; Location 2906</div><div class='noteText'>think it is precisely the history - as - morality - play element in all these narratives that makes me skeptical that the catastrophe will come , or that it will come in the semipredictable high temperatures plus population imbalances plus migration equals fatal political and economic crisis that this chapter has described .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 9: Catastrophe &gt; Page 203 &middot; Location 2908</div><div class='noteText'>Douthat imagines cimate chane rendering Africa uninhabitabe. Refugees pushing up into Europe. The EU splintering under the influence of strongmewho promise to stem the tide</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 10: Renaissance &gt; Page 215 &middot; Location 3065</div><div class='noteText'>As we have seen , it’s easier to declare a crisis in the liberal - democratic order than to actually discern viable alternatives to liberalism or democracy or capitalism .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 10: Renaissance &gt; Page 216 &middot; Location 3084</div><div class='noteText'>The resilient religious communitarianism of Mormon Utah , for instance , might be more relevant to the world’s future than anything happening in London or Paris or Washington , DC .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 10: Renaissance &gt; Page 216 &middot; Location 3085</div><div class='noteText'>I have not heard him talk about the higher birth rate of the mormons Nd how this might affect our political future.</h3>
