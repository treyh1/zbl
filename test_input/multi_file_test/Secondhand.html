<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 6 &middot; Location 224</div><div class='noteText'>Historically , personal identity revolved around religion , civic participation , and pride of ( oftentimes small ) place . But as those traditional bonds disintegrate in the face of industrialization , urbanization , and secularization , brands and objects become a means to curate and project who we are .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 15 &middot; Location 354</div><div class='noteText'>Generally , packers sort into five different categories : new , vintage , collectible , and resalable stuff goes to Empty the Nest’s thrift store ; reusable stuff too cheap or common for the thrift store is bound for the Salvation Army or a similar charity organization ; old electronics are bound for a specialized electronics recycler ; recyclable paper and metal goes to a general recycler ; and trash is bound for wherever the hauler takes it that day .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 16 &middot; Location 383</div><div class='noteText'>Some included basic cement recipes to aid in the repair of broken dishes .

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>2. Decluttering</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 26 &middot; Location 531</div><div class='noteText'>By the 1960s , affluent Japanese joked that Japan’s mythological three “ sacred treasures ” — the sword , the mirror , and the jewel — had been supplanted by three new sacred treasures : the television , the washing machine , and the refrigerator .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 564</div><div class='noteText'>“ Mottainai , ” she says to me , invoking a difficult - to - translate Japanese word that expresses a sense of regret over waste , as well as a desire to conserve . “ Before the 1960s , Japanese had this feeling , ” she explains . “ Even during the Edo period [ 1603 – 1868 ] , a kimono would be reused . ” But everything changed in the 1960s as the country entered its proud era of hypergrowth . “ Japanese forgot who they were and just bought , bought , bought . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 579</div><div class='noteText'>Japanese Shinto and Buddhism posit that spirits come to inhabit objects that have been used for years . “ Families go to the monks and temples after the death for prayers , ” Hamada says . “ And then the monks go to the home and clean it out . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 31 &middot; Location 605</div><div class='noteText'>It strikes me that the desire to see one’s things take on a second life is as much a matter of vanity as it is a concern for the planet or dismay at waste .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>3. The Flood</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 57 &middot; Location 984</div><div class='noteText'>“ People don’t seem to keep clothes as long anymore , ” she pipes up . “ And the people who make them know that and don’t bother to make good ones . ” The data backs her up . Between 2000 and 2015 , global clothing production doubled , while the average number of times that a garment was worn before disposal declined by 36 percent . 2</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1022</div><div class='noteText'>“ Customers doesn’t care how old something is . They care about how long it’s been on the shelf , ” is how Takaharu Kominato , the Bookoff spokesperson , explained it to me . “ Like food , old stuff goes bad . We call it a ‘ poison apple . ’</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1024</div><div class='noteText'>Bookoff’s tokoroten is widely imitated across Japan’s secondhand industry , just as Goodwill’s six - week cycle is copied by thrift businesses across North America .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 63 &middot; Location 1076</div><div class='noteText'>So far , no American organization has managed to emulate Bookoff and upgrade the manner in which Americans treat their used things .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>4. The Good Stuff</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 79 &middot; Location 1320</div><div class='noteText'>I think of the third floor at Midtown Antiques and its stale oak furniture made from Michigan’s forests . “ Do you ever buy American pieces ? ” She smiles and shakes her head . “ I don’t know anyone . ” I open my phone and show her pictures from the third floor , and her eyes widen .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 79 &middot; Location 1323</div><div class='noteText'>Clunky wooden furniture in US would sell in Malaysia</h3>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>5. Danshari</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 96 &middot; Location 1571</div><div class='noteText'>Across Southeast Asia small secondhand shops are often the dominant form of commerce , especially in rural towns .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 96 &middot; Location 1580</div><div class='noteText'>Collectively , these experiences enhance the already formidable reputation of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia , and lay the groundwork for what might sound absurd in the United State and Europe : a department store stocked only with used Japanese stuff .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1592</div><div class='noteText'>JALAN JALAN JAPAN reads the sign that stretches across the glass , butting up against Malaysian and Japanese flags . In Malay , the company name means “ Take a stroll in Japan . ” “ The mall is a ghost town , ” Inoue admitted . “ But it’s cheap , and in Malaysia you can promote via social media . Also , Malaysians love Japanese products . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 101 &middot; Location 1657</div><div class='noteText'>“ Are you worried that new Chinese products will eliminate the need for used in developing countries ? ” “ Yes . ” He</h3>

The Rose Bowl Flea Market in Pasadena is a particular favorite , and she speaks knowledgeably of U.S . thrift brands such as Savers , Buffalo Exchange ( “ it’s just like Bookoff ” ) , and Goodwill .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>6. Our Warehouse Is a Four-Bedroom House</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 112 &middot; Location 1801</div><div class='noteText'>“ Big money . In 2000 , there was a big crackdown on the mafia , so people jumped to secondhand from drugs . ” That makes some sense . Sensitivity to fast - changing markets and a talent for moving contraband help in both professions . “ Now you see people driving big pickups , spending five thousand , ten thousand dollars at a time on used goods . They went clean . It’s funny . What we do is not legal but it’s legal somehow . ”</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>7. Frayed Below the Stitch</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 135 &middot; Location 2143</div><div class='noteText'>Mississauga’s long , cold winters also helped , ensuring that the area’s summer clothes are worn briefly , and lightly . As a result , secondhand summer clothes from Canada ( and northern Europe ) are priced at a premium in the hot countries that are the biggest consumers of secondhand clothes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 138 &middot; Location 2201</div><div class='noteText'>The fifty - five - kilogram bundle is an industry standard embraced around the world , made in machines that compresses loose clothes into cubes ( occasionally leaving a sleeve hanging loose ) . Thanks to all the fabric , sound is muffled and buffeted . Voices go dead .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 145 &middot; Location 2293</div><div class='noteText'>“ We are interested in importing durable clothes , not cheap ones . If someone in the West has worn something and it comes here , it’s probably durable . ” “ Even if it’s made in China . ” “ Not everything from China is bad . Just what the Chinese send to Africa is bad . They save the good things for rich countries . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 152 &middot; Location 2388</div><div class='noteText'>In Cotonou , a clothing buyer doesn’t need to see a Forever 21 tag to know it’s cheap ; a simple pinch of the fabric will send it to the heavily discounted pile . Somebody might , in fact , buy it ; but nobody will overpay .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 155 &middot; Location 2434</div><div class='noteText'>For now , at least , the recycling of textiles is expensive and at the edge of the technologically feasible . “ We need more textile recycling , ” Ashif says to me . “ Long term , reuse is dead .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 155 &middot; Location 2435</div><div class='noteText'>Poor people are increasingly buying new Chinese clothes rathee than used Western. The clothes are lower quaity, which compounds the problem</h3>

Different tools for different applications . You have to make the tool and make it well . ” A janitorial service doesn’t want to buy rags with sequins that scratch the furniture ; an oil and gas company doesn’t want a polyester rag that’s going to discharge static electricity and set off an explosion ; a maid service doesn’t want a colored rag that’s going to bleed dye onto a countertop .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 163 &middot; Location 2544</div><div class='noteText'>It’s a quirk of the global economy that the most direct beneficiaries of the rise of fast fashion might be paper towel manufacturers .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 166 &middot; Location 2592</div><div class='noteText'>Located fifty miles north of Delhi , Panipat has been for three decades the place where unwanted woolen clothes from the world’s wealthy countries go after nobody wants to wear them anymore . That’s a lot of clothes . Unlike summer clothes , which flow to developing countries in warm climates , winter clothes typically lack a reuse market .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 169 &middot; Location 2633</div><div class='noteText'>For years , the leading consumers of Panipat’s shoddy were disaster - relief agencies like the Red Cross , which purchased shoddy blankets for use in relief operations following earthquakes and other disasters .</h3>

More Suitcases</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 246 &middot; Location 3739</div><div class='noteText'>After leaving Golden Jubilee Terminal , we take a walk beyond the container yard . Along the streets , tents and stalls packed with used goods recently off - loaded from containers line the streets , right up to the curbs . Various tents and stalls are devoted to used refrigerators , used office chairs , used bicycles , used clothing , and , of course , used televisions , computers , and other electronics . It’s a trade that should be celebrated . It’s a guarantee that somebody , somewhere , values old stuff . From an environmental perspective , it’s reuse on an industrial scale , the green economy made real . Better yet , no legislation or regulation was required to create it . A globalized trade in secondhand goods evolved on its own , connecting those who have stuff with those who don’t . Goodwill and Greenpeace couldn’t have devised a better system if they’d tried .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 253 &middot; Location 3842</div><div class='noteText'>As any Accra taxi driver will be happy to explain , Agbogbloshie is where Ghanaian things go after they’ve been used until they can’t be used or repaired</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 255 &middot; Location 3882</div><div class='noteText'>There are two groups among them . The larger one , comprising perhaps a dozen people , are Agbogbloshie scrap workers and business owners who arrive with ten - pound balls of insulated wire extracted mostly from cars . To sell that wire for scrap , they need the insulation burned off . So they pay the smaller group here , the one that tends the fires , to do just that . Every day , a few hundred pounds of charred copper are</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 255 &middot; Location 3884</div><div class='noteText'>Burning wire to get the scrap copper</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 256 &middot; Location 3894</div><div class='noteText'>In the years since Agbogbloshie was “ discovered ” by European and American environmental activists and journalists , hundreds of stories have been published about the place . I’ve read or watched most of them . They have a few things in common : fires , nameless young African men , the phrase “ primitive recycling , ” and a claim that Agbogbloshie is the “ largest ” something . Few , if any , include data , much less images of repair . Interviews with the repair businesses around Agbogbloshie are nonexistent . Implicit in these editorial choices is the assumption that Ghanaians are incapable of doing anything with foreign technology other than burning it .</h3>
