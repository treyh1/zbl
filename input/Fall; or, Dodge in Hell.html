<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 2 &gt; Page 110 &middot; Location 1697</div><div class='noteText'>Of crows , people tended to predicate the same traits that they did of Asians when they had forgotten politically correct habits of speech , or never acquired them in the first place . Crows were commendably intelligent , and forever busy , but you couldn’t tell them apart and their motives were inscrutable .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 2 &gt; Page 111 &middot; Location 1718</div><div class='noteText'>What looked like the entire Las Vegas Police Department was evacuating a high - rise casino / hotel , landing choppers on the roof , and ( clearly visible to long - lensed cameras on drones , or simply aimed out the windows of surrounding high - rises ) conducting a room - to - room search of a penthouse suite using sniffer dogs and Geiger counters . Military experts , watching the raid in real time on television , pointed out that the top of such a tower would be the optimal location to detonate a tactical nuke</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 2 &gt; Page 159 &middot; Location 2517</div><div class='noteText'>ENSU’s vision in the long term was noble and beautiful : they wanted to make a new thing called the Trusted Internet . Short term , the way they wanted to get there was to bury every old - school blog in fake comments ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 2 &gt; Page 169 &middot; Location 2673</div><div class='noteText'>The total budget for the hoax was estimated to have been less than one million dollars . The networks had actually paid out more than that for the privilege of airing fake footage supplied by the hoaxers . Those payments , made in Bitcoin , had gone to anonymous overseas accounts presumably controlled by the hoaxers . Between that and short - selling various affected stocks on Wall Street , it appeared that they had paid for the exploit many times over .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 194 &middot; Location 3054</div><div class='noteText'>“ So - called Christianity , as it existed up until recently , is based on a big lie , ” Ted explained . “ The most successful conspiracy of all time . And it was all summed up in the symbolism of the cross . Every cross you see on a mainstream church , or worn as jewelry , or on a rosary or what have you , is another repetition of that lie . ” “ And what is that lie exactly ? ” Phil asked . He already knew . But he and the others all wanted to hear a living human actually say it , just as spectacle . “ That Jesus was crucified . ” There . He’d said it . No one could speak . Ted took their silence as a request for more in the same vein . “ That the Son of God , the most powerful incarnate being in the history of the universe , allowed Himself to be scourged and humiliated and taken out in the most disgraceful way you can imagine . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 194 &middot; Location 3062</div><div class='noteText'>“ The church that was built on the lie of the Crucifixion , ” Ted continued , “ had two basic tenets . One was the lovey - dovey Jesus who went around being nice to people — basically , just the kind of behavior you would expect from the kind of beta who would allow himself to be spat on , to be nailed to a piece of wood . The second was this notion that the Old Testament no longer counted for anything , that the laws laid down in Leviticus were part of an old covenant that could simply be ignored after , and because , he was nailed up on that cross . We have exposed all that as garbage . Nonsense . A conspiracy by the elites to keep people meek and passive . The only crosses you’ll see in our church are on fire , and the symbolism of that has nothing to do with the KKK . It means we reject the false church that was built upon the myth of the Crucifixion . ”</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 200 &middot; Location 3159</div><div class='noteText'>Direct , unfiltered exposure to said flumes — the torrent of porn , propaganda , and death threats , 99.9 percent of which were algorithmically generated and never actually seen by human eyes — was relegated to a combination of AIs and Third World eyeball farms , which was to say huge warehouses in hot places where people sat on benches or milled around gazing at stuff that the AIs had been unable to classify . They were the informational equivalent of the wretches who clambered around mountainous garbage dumps in Delhi or Manila looking for rags .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 226 &middot; Location 3557</div><div class='noteText'>“ It’s not an actual military , ” said her great - uncle Bob , twisting around from the front seat where he was , literally , riding shotgun . “ If you were setting up a real military , here’s what you wouldn’t do : you wouldn’t issue every single guy his own collection of fifty - seven different small arms and an infinite quantity of ammunition and nothing else . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 236 &middot; Location 3722</div><div class='noteText'>Now , theater , and later movies , eventually get us into the realm of shared hallucinations . But those are neatly boxed in both space and time , and there’s a bit of ceremony to them . You buy the ticket , you enter the theater , you sit down , the lights dim , everyone in the place shares the same hallucination at the same time , lights come back up , it’s over , you go outside . Even old - school TV had some of that . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Part 3 &gt; Page 236 &middot; Location 3725</div><div class='noteText'>A ceremony around when we will consume media.</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 245 &middot; Location 3881</div><div class='noteText'>The western plains had been tough to live on even in the cooler , rainier heyday of white settlement and were now well on their way to becoming a desert . They simply couldn’t support that many humans , and the flat land and sluggish rivers held no appeal for recreationalists or builders of vacation homes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 246 &middot; Location 3903</div><div class='noteText'>Billboards in the traditional sense had gone the way of gas stations and ashtrays . Much cheaper and more efficient was to target the audience with personalized messages that would show up in their glasses , and those messages had better be interesting and germane or else they’d be filtered out by even the most bargain - basement edit stream .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 3 &gt; Page 251 &middot; Location 3975</div><div class='noteText'>“ Just saying that for everyone else in this car the post - Moab world is basically all we’ve ever known .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Part 4 &gt; Page 267 &middot; Location 4197</div><div class='noteText'>Zula had reviewed this anonymous candidate’s application more than once over the last several months , and given it a final once - over before she had walked into her office , but it didn’t have a name associated with it . Only a PURDAH . Which wasn’t unusual . Marcus had , in fact , made it almost mandatory . Concealing names , genders , and the like behind a PURDAH was a way to reduce the possibility that candidates would benefit from positive , or suffer from negative , discrimination .</h3>

Behind them the bar had been crammed solid with lawyers , friends of El , and media . They had all looked on , in what was described as a festive atmosphere , as Sinjin Kerr , the lord chancellor of Zelrijk - Aalberg , had reminded the Belgian cops that they had no authority on this side of the crack and that , if need be , force would be employed to preserve the integrity of the border .</h3>

They had to move beyond the practice of chopping off the heads of the deceased and throwing away the rest . Henceforward every client would be scanned in toto , heads to toes , and efforts would be made to collect data about their microbiome and any other non - neurological phenomena that would be overlooked by an ion - beam scanning system that only cared about neurons .</h3>

In the stats it was possible to see a crisp fault line that coincided with the advent of full - body scanning . Processes that entered Bitworld with full information about the bodies from which they were derived ended up living in digital simulacra of those bodies . Those that had come into the world from severed heads showed a wider range of morphologies . But they also had a much higher failure rate , and some left no trace in the system at all . If they were alive , they were not discernible .</h3>

Better to remain indoors and do as much as possible through telepresence .</h3>

Its “ head ” was just a slender conning tower speckled with tiny lenses .</h3>
