But the unintended result is that all the clout and money generated online has begun to accumulate around the people close to only certain highly secretive computers , many of which are essentially spying operations designed to gain information to sell advertising</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Location 138</div><div class='noteText'>But the notion that cheaper computers , smartphones , etc . , will compensate for the growing economic gap is just not true . Ultimately mounting poverty will outpace cost savings and everyone will suffer .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 238</div><div class='noteText'>The brittle character of maturing computer programs can cause digital designs to get frozen into place by a process known as lock - in . This happens when many software programs are designed to work with an existing one .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 256</div><div class='noteText'>But software is worse than railroads , because it must always adhere with absolute perfection to a boundlessly particular , arbitrary , tangled , intractable messiness .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 256</div><div class='noteText'>I wish he would say more about why this is so.</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 327</div><div class='noteText'>An unnerving element of this gadget is that it is haunted by a weird set of unpredictable user interface delays . One’s mind waits for the response to the press of a virtual button , but it doesn’t come for a while . An odd tension builds during that moment , and easy intuition is replaced by nervousness . It is the ghost of UNIX , still refusing to accommodate the rhythms of my body and my mind , after all these years .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 327</div><div class='noteText'>From my own experience as a user of phones and tablets and computers, this seems like an unfair criticism.</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 346</div><div class='noteText'>The ideas expressed by the file include the notion that human expression comes in severable chunks that can be organized as leaves on an abstract tree — and that the chunks have versions and need to be matched to compatible applications .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 361</div><div class='noteText'>Who would have guessed ( at least at first ) that millions of people would put so much effort into a project without the presence of advertising , commercial motive , threat of punishment , charismatic figures , identity politics , exploitation of the fear of death , or any of the other classic motivators of mankind .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 412</div><div class='noteText'>In fact , the groupthink problem I’m worried about isn’t so much in the minds of the technologists themselves , but in the minds of the users of the tools the cybernetic totalists are promoting .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 1 - Missing Persons &gt; Location 469</div><div class='noteText'>culture has entered into a nostalgic malaise . Online culture is dominated by trivial mashups of the culture that existed before the onset of mashups , and by fandom responding to the dwindling outposts of centralized mass media .

Can the judge tell which is the man ? If not , is the computer conscious ? Intelligent ? Does it deserve equal rights ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 - An Apocalypse of Self-Abdication &gt; Location 687</div><div class='noteText'>What the test really tells us , however , even if it’s not necessarily what Turing hoped it would say , is that machine intelligence can only be known in a relative sense , in the eyes of a human beholder . *</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Chapter 2 - An Apocalypse of Self-Abdication &gt; Location 750</div><div class='noteText'>Whenever a computer is imagined to be intelligent , what is really happening is that humans have abandoned aspects of the subject at hand in order to remove from consideration whatever the computer is blind to .</h3>

This is what happens today with a lot of content ; often you don’t know where a quoted fragment from a news story came from , who wrote a comment , or who shot a video . A continuation of the present trend will make us like various medieval religious empires , or like North Korea , a society with a single book . *</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Chapter 3 - The Noosphere Is Just Another Name for Everyone’s Inner Troll &gt; Location 999</div><div class='noteText'>But the critical difference between the state doing it vs. technologists doing it is that &quot;users&quot; (read: citizens) don't have a choice when the state does it but users (read: consumers) can always walk away from the technologists.
