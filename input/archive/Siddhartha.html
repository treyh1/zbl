<h2 class='sectionHeading'>THE SON OF THE BRAHMAN</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 7 &middot; Location 41</div><div class='noteText'>And where was Atman to be found , where did He reside , where did his eternal heart beat , where else but in one's own self , in its innermost part , in its indestructible part , which everyone had in himself ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 7 &middot; Location 42</div><div class='noteText'>what is atman? god or place or something else?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 60</div><div class='noteText'>It had to be found , the pristine source in one's own self , it had to be possessed ! Everything else was searching , was a detour , was getting lost .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 8 &middot; Location 64</div><div class='noteText'>And among all the wise and wisest men , he knew and whose instructions he had received , among all of them there was no one , who had reached it completely , the heavenly world , who had quenched it completely , the eternal thirst .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 8 &middot; Location 68</div><div class='noteText'>add a picture of the banyan tree</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 73</div><div class='noteText'>Once , Samanas had travelled through Siddhartha's town , ascetics on a pilgrimage , three skinny , withered men , neither old nor young , with dusty and bloody shoulders , almost naked , scorched by the sun , surrounded by loneliness , strangers and enemies to the world , strangers and lank jackals in the realm of humans . Behind them blew a hot scent of quiet passion , of destructive service , of merciless self - denial .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 86</div><div class='noteText'>The Brahman fell silent , and remained silent for so long that the stars in the small window wandered and changed their relative positions , ' ere the silence was broken .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 9 &middot; Location 88</div><div class='noteText'>stars do wander</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>WITH THE SAMANAS</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 128</div><div class='noteText'>A goal stood before Siddhartha , a single goal : to become empty , empty of thirst , empty of wishing , empty of dreams , empty of joy and sorrow .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 15 &middot; Location 163</div><div class='noteText'>&quot; What is meditation ? What is leaving one's body ? What is fasting ? What is holding one's breath ? It is fleeing from the self , it is a short escape of the agony of being a self , it is a short numbing of the senses against the pain and the pointlessness of life . The same escape , the same short numbing is what the driver of an ox - cart finds in the inn , drinking a few bowls of rice - wine or fermented coconut - milk . Then he won't feel his self any more , then he won't feel the pains of life any more , then he finds a short numbing of the senses . When he falls asleep over his bowl of rice - wine , he'll find the same what Siddhartha and Govinda find when they escape their bodies through long exercises , staying in the non - self .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>GOTAMA</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 282</div><div class='noteText'>the two Samanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm , by the quietness of his appearance , in which there was no searching , no desire , no imitation , no effort to be seen , only light and peace .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 24 &middot; Location 284</div><div class='noteText'>curious to see &quot;imitation&quot; listed here as a negative desire.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 356</div><div class='noteText'>This is why I am continuing my travels - - not to seek other , better teachings , for I know there are none , but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my goal by myself or to die .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>KAMALA</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 42 &middot; Location 558</div><div class='noteText'>You are learning easily , Siddhartha , thus you should also learn this : love can be obtained by begging , buying , receiving it as a gift , finding it in the street , but it cannot be stolen</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 42 &middot; Location 565</div><div class='noteText'>&quot; Friend , many would like to know this . You must do what you've learned and ask for money , clothes , and shoes in return . There is no other way for a poor man to obtain money . What might you be able to do ? &quot; &quot; I can think . I can wait . I can fast</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 606</div><div class='noteText'>&quot; Yesterday , I told you I knew how to think , to wait , and to fast , but you thought this was of no use . But it is useful for many things , Kamala</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 614</div><div class='noteText'>When you throw a rock into the water , it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water . This is how it is when Siddhartha has a goal , a resolution . Siddhartha does nothing , he waits , he thinks , he fasts , but he passes through the things of the world like a rock through water , without doing anything , without stirring ; he is drawn , he lets himself fall . His goal attracts him , because he</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 617</div><div class='noteText'>doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the goal . This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas . This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons . Nothing is effected by daemons , there are no daemons . Everyone can perform magic , everyone can reach his goals , if he is able to think , if he is able to wait , if he is able to fast</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>WITH THE CHILDLIKE PEOPLE</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 47 &middot; Location 631</div><div class='noteText'>Surely , I am without possessions . But I am so voluntarily , and therefore I am not destitute</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 48 &middot; Location 650</div><div class='noteText'>&quot; Writing is good , thinking is better . Being smart is good , being patient is better</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 49 &middot; Location 657</div><div class='noteText'>Kamaswami conducted his business with care and often with passion , but Siddhartha looked upon all of this as if it was a game , the rules of which he tried hard to learn precisely , but the contents of which did not touch his heart</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 669</div><div class='noteText'>Siddhartha surpassed him , the merchant , in calmness and equanimity , and in the art of listening and deeply understanding previously unknown people</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 673</div><div class='noteText'>he is never afraid of failure , he is never upset by a loss</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 51 &middot; Location 694</div><div class='noteText'>Siddhartha never listened to Kamaswami's worries and Kamaswami had many worries .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 51 &middot; Location 694</div><div class='noteText'>this is a nice notion. to participate in business like it is a game, but harder to put into practice. i would be annoyed with S if i were K.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 52 &middot; Location 703</div><div class='noteText'>He saw mankind going trough life in a childlike or animallike manner , which he loved and also despised at the same time . He saw them toiling , saw them suffering , and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely unworthy of this price , for money , for little pleasures , for being slightly honoured , he saw them scolding and insulting each other , he saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile , and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 52 &middot; Location 707</div><div class='noteText'>maybe we should all spend time in a monestary before we enter the workforce.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 52 &middot; Location 713</div><div class='noteText'>He gave advice , he pitied , he made gifts , he let them cheat him a bit , and this entire game and the passion with which all people played this game occupied his thoughts just as much as the gods and Brahmans used to occupy them .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>SANSARA</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 55 &middot; Location 743</div><div class='noteText'>For a long time , Siddhartha had lived the life of the world and of lust , though without being a part of it . His senses , which he had killed off in hot years as a Samana , had awoken again , he had tasted riches , had tasted lust , had tasted power ; nevertheless he had still remained in his heart for a long time a Samana ; Kamala , being smart , had realized this quite right . It was still the art of thinking , of waiting , of fasting , which guided his life ;</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 56 &middot; Location 769</div><div class='noteText'>He envied them for the one thing that was missing from him and that they had , the importance they were able to attach to their lives , the amount of passion in their joys and fears , the fearful but sweet happiness of being constantly in love . These people were all of the time in love with themselves , with women , with their children , with honours or money , with plans or hopes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 56 &middot; Location 772</div><div class='noteText'>maybe this is the price that you pay for wisdom and serenity. you are not troubled by anything but you also do not desire anything. isnt this the way that people feel when they are on strong anti depressants?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 57 &middot; Location 789</div><div class='noteText'>He was a feared gambler , few dared to take him on , so high and audacious were his stakes . He played the game due to a pain of his heart , losing and wasting his wretched money in the game brought him an angry joy , in no other way he could demonstrate his disdain for wealth , the merchants ' false god , more clearly and more mockingly .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 57 &middot; Location 791</div><div class='noteText'>i always thought that high stakes gambling brought people a rush, but maybe they are also affected by a self loathing. they worked so hard to earn all that money and then they throw it all away put it all to hazard. i never thought about how a gambler could be feared but now i see how this can be true.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 60 &middot; Location 842</div><div class='noteText'>for how long had he reached no height any more , how even and dull was the manner in which his path had passed through life , for many long years , without a high goal , without thirst , without elevation , content with small lustful pleasures and yet never satisfied !</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>BY THE RIVER</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 64 &middot; Location 905</div><div class='noteText'>the holy word Om on his lips , that then he had fallen asleep and had now woken up and was looking at the world as a new man .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Note - Page 64 &middot; Location 906</div><div class='noteText'>like don draper with the om</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 999</div><div class='noteText'>&quot; It is good , &quot; he thought , &quot; to get a taste of everything for oneself , which one needs to know . That lust for the world and riches do not belong to the good things , I have already learned as a child . I have known it for a long time , but I have experienced only now . And now I know it , don't just know it in my memory , but in my eyes , in my heart , in my stomach . Good for me , to know this ! &quot;</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>THE FERRYMAN</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 72 &middot; Location 1031</div><div class='noteText'>But out of all secrets of the river , he today only saw one , this one touched his soul . He saw : this water ran and ran , incessantly it ran , and was nevertheless always there , was always at all times the same and yet new in every moment ! Great be he who would grasp this , understand this ! He understood and grasped it not , only felt some idea of it stirring , a distant memory , divine voices .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 75 &middot; Location 1079</div><div class='noteText'>All I'm able to do is to listen and to be godly , I have learned nothing else . If I was able to say and teach it , I might be a wise man , but like this I am only a ferryman , and it is my task to ferry people across the river .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>OM</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 91 &middot; Location 1326</div><div class='noteText'>Though he was near perfection and was bearing his final wound , it still seemed to him as if those childlike people were his brothers , their vanities , desires for possession , and ridiculous aspects were no longer ridiculous to him , became understandable , became lovable , even became worthy of veneration to him .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 92 &middot; Location 1339</div><div class='noteText'>Slowly blossomed , slowly ripened in Siddhartha the realisation , the knowledge , what wisdom actually was , what the goal of his long search was . It was nothing but a readiness of the soul , an ability , a secret art , to think every moment , while living his life , the thought of oneness , to be able to feel and inhale the oneness .</h3>
